#Condfundo++ Idea

##Main Theme
Managing impact of a natural disaster.

##Idea Description
Since the app store is filled with mostly alert-based disaster management apps, we present a **centralised server-based solution** to manage the natural disaster. The server would be constantly updated with the details of the relief projects, support and notification system provided from the *NGOs, disaster management government bodies, volunteering groups and media bodies*. These details would be pushed to an **_app_** installed in the user's smartphones. However, Internet connection becomes a hurdle once the place is hit by some natural disaster, so to overcome this problem we propose a novel FM radio based solution. In the FM based solution, the above-mentioned data would be circulated 24X7 through an authorised FM band artificially in a repetitive fashion.

##App Description
-The app will have a centralised server, some intermediate NGO groups who are supposed to have an internet connection, and the calamity-struck common people who will avail the service using a normal mobile network.
-The app is supposed to take care of the distribution of food and health supplies, taking care of the grievances that the users may post. It is also supposed to ensure equitable distribution of the supplies based on the priority of service that is to be provided so that no one is treated unfairly. It will also have the provision for people to monitor their waiting time when expecting a particular health service.

##Impact after successful implementation.
-Ensures equitable distribution of resources as opposed to the concentration of resources among certain groups.
-Can take into account the grievances of every individual without the need to have an intermediate body for representation, which allows faster service in situations of urgency.
-It will always keep the users updated, provided a mobile network is available, so that they can monitor the services instead of being cluelessly optimistic.
